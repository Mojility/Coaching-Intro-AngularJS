# Building an AngularJS SPA

This workshop is broken into 5 stages, with an accompanying presentation. It is a work in progress, and should be tracking Angular as it evolves, as this Intro to Angular topic is a popular one in my Coaching practice.

## To Do

1. Break up presentation and build into a more web friendly format
1. Find nicer ways to move the up-front rules discussion into the body of the presentation
