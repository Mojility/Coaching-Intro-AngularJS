# Building an AngularJS SPA

This workshop is broken into 5 stages, with an accompanying presentation. It is a work in progress, and should be tracking Angular as it evolves, as this Intro to Angular topic is a popular one in my Coaching practice.

## To Do

1. Break up presentation and build into a more web friendly format (revealjs? impressjs? flowtimejs?)
1. Find nicer ways to move the up-front rules discussion into the body of the presentation

## Requirements

1. I chose to use NodeJS / npm for managing dependencies, most notably AngularJS and Karma. Just run 'npm install' in any of the stages to set up each stage's dependencies (they are not in this repo)

## Speaker Notes

These are my notes I use when going through this presentation. There is a separate snippets file for code copy/paste throughout the presentation, but I like to type this stuff out where possible.

### Stage 0

- starting bare, package.json to npm install AngularJS
- create blank html with ng-app, add angular, do simple {{}} calculation to confirm working

### Stage 1

- add Karma to package.json
- add main.js
- create null filter
- add spec
- run karma
- make it pass
- show it in html

### Stage 2
